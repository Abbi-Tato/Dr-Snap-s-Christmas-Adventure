C: What did you think of the last section? It may have not gotten much attention but a number of people found it rather controversial
"I think it's certainly an interestng theory. Slimes never seem to eat much, and spend most of their time hopping around sunny fields. Therefore, it's entirely reasonable to assume their gain their energy by photosynthesis instead of eating.

Dr Snap smiles weakly. "I haven't been in contact with my family in quite some time, and I haven't seen my ex-boyfriend in about a year also.

Dr Snap rummages around in a small knapsack that was sitting by the armchair he was sitting in. "I was worried it would seem strange, but now I know it's okay". He hands you a wooly christmas sweater identical to his own, but this time emblazoned with frolicking jailcats. He smiles at you, and you feel at peace. The two of you embrace, and in that moment, by that fire, in that room ; you know it's all going to be okay in the end. (Perfect Ending!)
