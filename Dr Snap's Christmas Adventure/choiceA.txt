A: That paper completely sucks, I wish I'd never written it.
"Well, I can't tell you how to feel about your own work. But I thought it was a fantastic paper, it taught me a lot about what goes on inside the little fellas". Dr Snap sighs, before turning back to the fire. "I'm really sorry you feel that way about yourself. But that's a little off-topic. Please take a seat.
A:It's delicious, you did fantastic!
The doctor smiles. "Thank you, I did my best. Baking is rather tricky, isn't it? It was my first try in a while since I was having people over. 
A:I'm sorry, but I thought this would be a proper christmas party with all sorts of people from all over ; I feel a bit lead on

Doctor Snap looks over at the grandfather clock sitting in the corner of the room. "I'm ever so sorry, it's getting awfully late. You should probably head home." Standing in the doorway, you step out into the snow. Demi gives you a slightly dirty look as you walk away from her, away from Dr Snap's house for the first, and last time (BAD ENDING)
