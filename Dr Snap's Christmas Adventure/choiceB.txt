B:You... read that? I didn't hear anyone talking about it
"Of course! I was considering a paper of my own about the subject, but as it turns out that won't be needed, you did a fantastic job"
B:I'm sorry... it's not fantastic. But all you need to do is leave the biscuits on some baking paper on the tray, and their bottoms won't burn!
Doctor Snap perks up quite a bit. "Of course, why didn't I think of that! The next batch will be a lot better now". He's smiling slightly now.
B:I was quite worried about all the people myself, I'm not amazing with crowds. I'm always happy to talk science with you Snap.
Dr Snap smiles, if a little stiffly. "Of course, it's lovely to talk science with someone as amazing at monsterology as you.
Dr Snap looks at you, and you see a genuine calm spreading across his wrinkled brow for the first time since you arrived there. "Thank you for coming, it has warmed my heart to spend christmas with someone other than my monsters. I hope to see you again next year." You smile back, and begin putting on your coat to leave. On the way out, you see Demi crack a slight smile at you. The night is dark, but your heart is light with love for this kind old gentleman. (GOOD ENDING)
